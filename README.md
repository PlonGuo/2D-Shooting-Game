# 2D-Shooting-Game
To play the game successfully, please download everything that I attached in Image branch and Sounds branch, of course, the 2DShooting.py too. Make sure all elements are in the same directory, and open the 2DShooting.py in PyCharm, and you are good to go. Enjoy this game! :)

I will try to deploy this game online. I will post the url here if I deployed if successfully!
